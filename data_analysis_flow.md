1. [DataExplorer包](https://github.com/boxuancui/DataExplorer)  R package to simplify Exploratory Data Analysis  数据探索性分析

2. [mapmate包](https://github.com/leonawicz/mapmate) mapmate is an R package for generating and saving a sequence of plots to disk as a still image sequence intended for later use in data animation production.  地理信息时空网络可视化

3. [magick包](https://github.com/ropensci/magick)
Bindings to ImageMagick: the most comprehensive open-source image processing library available. Supports many common formats (png, jpeg, tiff, pdf, etc) and manipulations (rotate, scale, crop, trim, flip, blur, etc). All operations are vectorized via the Magick++ STL meaning they operate either on a single frame or a series of frames for working with layers, collages, or animation. In RStudio images are automatically previewed when printed to the console, resulting in an interactive editing environment. 图像处理

4. [bayesplot](https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot) bayesplot R package for plotting Bayesian models  贝叶斯模型参数MCMC后验分布
bayesplot is an R package providing an extensive library of plotting functions for use after fitting Bayesian models (typically with MCMC). Currently bayesplot offers a variety of plots of posterior draws, visual MCMC diagnostics, as well as graphical posterior predictive checking. Additional functionality (e.g. for forecasting/out-of-sample prediction and other inference-related tasks) will be added in future releases.
